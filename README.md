# automafia

An auto-moderated version of mafia, implemented in terrible PHP and MySQL

*WARNING!* This code was written many years ago before I knew anything about software development. It is being shared for amusement purposes only.

## Original description

**AutoMafia**, a web-based version of Mafia (also known as Werewolf or Vampire). See the [help page](mafia/help.php) for more information on the game of Mafia and how to play it.

### Features

The aim of AutoMafia is to perform the job of the moderator, while allowing for as much gameplay variety as possible:

*   [Over 30 different character types](mafia/charlist.php) to choose from
*   Complete freedom for players to [create a virtually infinite variety of game setups](mafia/newsetup.php) (including closed and random setups)
*   Potential for huge games with hundreds of players and numerous factions competing for victory (which would be very difficult for a human moderater to run)
*   [Game statistics](mafia/stats.php) with leaderboards for the most successful players and the most popular setups

Planned features for future versions:

*   A **narrator** role, to allow a player to sit out from the game and provide a story, while AutoMafia carries out the other moderator tasks
*   More characters (potential additions include; Mafia Janitor, Mafia Hitman, Bulletproof Villager, Bodyguard, and Jester)
*   Player avatars
